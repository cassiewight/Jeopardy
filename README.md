# Jeopardy
Jeopardy with custom clues written in HTML, CSS and JS (JQuery)


I made this game for my Mother's birthday, so the clues are customized to her.  It is made to be displayed on a large monitor and played in a group.
One person plays the role of Alex Trebec, clicking on the clues and reading them out, determining who buzzed in first (you have to be creative with some props) and clicking whether said person got it wrong or right.
There are two daily doubles which allow the user to place a bet.  Click 'Final Jeopardy' at the bottom of the page when it's time to hear the classic jingle.

The clues are hard coded for now but further work on the app can include modification to support user customization or API integration.
